# Package and version data 
Quilt is a data package manager (like `pip` or `npm`, but for serialized data).
Quilt consists of a client-side data compiler (this repository) and a
[server-side registry](https://quiltdata.com), where packages are stored.

## Overview of commands
* **build** to create a package from files
* **push** a package to store it in the registry
* **install** a package to download it locally
* **import** packages to use them in code

## Future
Quilt currently supports Python. Spark and R support are in the works.

# Commands 
* `quilt -h` for a list of commands
* `quilt CMD -h` for info about a command
* `quilt login`
* `quilt build USER/PACKAGE FILE.YML`
* `quilt push USER/PACKAGE` stores the package in the registry
* `quilt install [-x HASH | -v VERSION | -t TAG] USER/PACKAGE` installs a package
* `quilt access list USER/PACKAGE` to see who has access to a package
* `quilt access {add, remove} USER/PACKAGE ANOTHER_USER` to set access
  * `quilt access add public` makes a package visible to the world
* `quilt log USER/PACKAGE` to see all changes to a package
* `quilt version list USER/PACKAGE` to see versions of a package
* `quilt version add USER/PACKAGE VERSION HASH` to create a new version
* `quilt tag list USER/PACKAGE` to see tags of a package
* `quilt tag add USER/PACKAGE TAG HASH` to create a new tag
  * The tag "latest" is automatically added to the most recent push
* `quilt tag remove USER/PACKAGE TAG` to delete a tag

# Known Issues
## Python 3.2 is not supported

## HDF5
If you encounter missing HDF5 libraries, try the following:
- Mac:
  - If necessary, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
  - `brew update`
  - `brew install homebrew/science/hdf5@1.8` (pytables doesn't work with hdf5@1.10)
  - Determine your HDF5 directory: `brew --prefix homebrew/science/hdf5@1.8`
  - `export HDF5_DIR=*YOUR_HDF5_DIRECTORY*` (add this line to your .bash_profile)
- Linux:
  - `sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev`

# Build.yml options
``` yaml
contents:
  GROUP_NAME:
    DATA_NAME:
      file: PATH_TO_FILE
      transform: {id, csv, tsv, ssv, xls, xlsx}
      sep="\t" # tab separated values
      # or any key-word argument to [pandas.read_csv](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html)
```

## Column types
Supported Pandas column types (via dtype:)
* int
* bool
* float
* complex
* str
* unicode
* buffer

Everything else becomes type object. See [dtypes](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.dtypes.html).

# Developer
- `pip install pylint pytest pytest-cov`
- `pytest` will run any `test_*` files in any subdirectory
- All new modules, files, and functions should have a corresponding test 
- Track test code coverage by running: `python -m pytest --cov=quilt/tools/ --cov-report html:cov_html quilt/test -v`
- View coverage results by opening cov_html/index.html

## Local installation
1. `git clone https://github.com/quiltdata/quilt.git`
1. `cd quilt`
1. From the repository root: `pip install -e .`
